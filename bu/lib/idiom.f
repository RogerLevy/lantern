\ better namespacing system

\ idioms have:
\  a parent idiom
\  accessory idioms
\  a private wordlist
\  a public wordlist

\ important words:
\   `idiom` <name>
\     creates a new idiom.  has different behavior depending on
\     if currently importing the current file.  if not importing, it creates a
\     new idiom, extending the current one (whatever it might be) so that that
\     idiom is included in the new one's search order, except for its private
\     words.  if importing, and the idiom is not already defined, it creates
\     a new idiom without extending the current one.  `import` adds it as
\     an accessory before restoring the current idiom.  if importing and the
\     idiom is already defined, compilation of the rest of the current file
\     being interpreted is cancelled.
\     the default "current" wordlist for defining words is the idiom's public
\     one.
\  `include` is extended to save and restore `idiom`, the current idiom.
\  `import` saves and restores `idiom` as well as a flag that `create-idiom`
\     uses to change its behavior.
\  `.idiom` prints info about the current idiom.  usually, idioms set the
\     search order themselves when executed.
\  `set-idiom` takes an idiom and sets the search order (it replaces it.)
\     the default "current" wordlist for defining words is the idiom's public
\     one.
\  `breadth` the value that stores the maximum # of accesory idioms the next
\     idiom can have.
\  `public` - set current wordlist for defining to current idiom's "publics"
\  `private` - set current wordlist for defining to current idiom's "privates"

\ Cheatsheet:
\  Create:
\    `INCLUDE` a file that declares an idiom that isn't already defined in the current search order.
\  Enter:
\    Call the name of an idiom.  Its public and private words, predecessor's public words,
\    and imported public words, will be available.  This is the search order from first to last.
\      1) Idiom's publics
\      2) Idiom's privates
\      3) Imported idioms' publics
\      4) Predecessor idiom's publics
\  Public/Private:
\    Call `PUBLIC:` and `PRIVATE:` to switch between defining public and private words of the current
\    idiom.  Private words won't be available to any other idiom, unless you explicitly export them.
\  Exit:
\    There is no explicit word to "exit" an idiom.
\    Instead you enter a different idiom, or call `GLOBAL`, which turns idioms "off" and resets
\    the search order and current wordlist to `FORTH-WORDLIST`.
\  Debug:
\    Call `.IDIOM`.  The imported idioms and parents of the current idiom will be shown.
\  Inherit:
\    Declare or enter an idiom.
\    `INCLUDE` file that declares child idiom
\    This new idiom will "know" the public words of all of its predecessors.
\  Extend:
\    `INCLUDE` a file that declares an idiom that already exists in the current search order.
\     or
\    `INCLUDE` a file that at the top simply enters the idiom you want to extend.
\  Import:
\    `IMPORT` a file that declares an idiom.  If it's already defined in the current search order, it
\    will simply be imported, and the rest of the file will be skipped.
\  Isolate:
\    In a file, enter any "predecessor" idiom (or say `GLOBAL`) and then declare/extend an idiom.
\    If you `IMPORT` this file, it will be imported into the current idiom in the importing file.
\    If you `INCLUDE` this file, it will NOT be imported.
\    In both cases, the name of the isolated idiom will only be available in its parent.
\    Therefore, it can only be imported by "related" idioms.
\  Encapsulate:
\    The idioms imported by an idiom, and its parents, are NOT imported along with it
\    when impored into another idiom.  Only its public words.
\  Export:
\    The private or public wordlists of the current idiom can be given names that can
\    be automatically defined within the parent idiom or the Forth wordlist.
\    Use `@publics | @privates EXPORT-WORDLIST <name>  \ naming convention:  <idiomname>ing`
\    If for whatever reason both wordlists are desired, export the @privates and import or
\    extend the idiom.
